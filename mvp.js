// MVP

// Model-view-presenter (MVP) is a derivative of the MVC design pattern which
// focuses on improving presentation logic. Unlike MVC, invocations from the
// view are delegated to the presenter, which are decoupled from the view and
// instead talk to it through an interface. This allows for all kinds of
// useful things such as being able to mock views in unit tests.
